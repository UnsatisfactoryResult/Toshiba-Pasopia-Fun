The Pasopia 700 was the last model in the series, and also quite unique. All previous versions were wedge shaped all in one units with two PAC (expansion cartridge) slots, and no onboard storage. The 700 was a traditional desktop setup with separate keyboard, 1 or 2 built in floppy drives, and only PAC slot 2 accessible from the outside. PAC slot 1 was moved inside to the main board, and instead of a 40 pin female header it became a 50 pin male IDC header.
