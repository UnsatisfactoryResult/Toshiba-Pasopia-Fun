The Pasopia 700 was the last model in the series, and also quite unique. All previous versions were wedge shaped all in one units with two PAC (expansion cartridge) slots, and no onboard storage. The 700 was a traditional desktop setup with separate keyboard, 1 or 2 built in floppy drives, and only PAC slot 2 accessible from the outside. PAC slot 1 was moved inside to the main board, and instead of a 40 pin female header it became a 50 pin male IDC header. 

PAC slot 2 was used for system expansion, system RAM, kanji ROM, and even joystick adapters (JOYPAC2) were available.

PAC slot 1 I believe was used for BASIC? There was also a diagnostic ROM for Toshiba repair techs. This software was also available on floppy disk apparently.

PACs are hard to come by, and can be expensive. While also a bit expensive, the XPAC2 is a doujin (homebrew/hobby) project from A Japanese person that goes by zak. This combines 7 different PACs in one, and you can even copy files between the SD card and floppy disks. He has done so many great projects, like porting games, creating hardware, and writing custom programs for the Pasopia. Check out his amazing blog here: https://pasopia700.blogspot.com/
