# Toshiba-Pasopia-Fun
General info about Toshiba's line of 8 bit computers released in Japan in the early 1980s. Western markets also received early versions as the T100 series. Not to be confused with their line of MSX computers also using the Pasopia name.

System expansion is handled by expansion cartridges called PACs. All models feature two PAC slots. The PAC1 slot uses a 44 pin female header on all but the 700 models, which used a 50 pin male IDC header. The PAC2 slot uses a 20 pin female header on all models.

PACs are hard to come by, and can be expensive. While also a bit expensive, the XPAC2 is a doujin (homebrew/hobby) project from a Japanese person that goes by zak. This combines 7 different PACs in one, and you can even copy files between an SD card and floppy disks. He has done so many great projects, like porting games, creating hardware, and writing custom programs for the Pasopia. Check out his amazing blog here: https://pasopia700.blogspot.com/
